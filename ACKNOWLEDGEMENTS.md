**Description:**
The C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset consists of multivariate time series from turbofan engine simulations. The dataset includes run-to-failure trajectories under various operational conditions and fault modes, making it ideal for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and predictive maintenance research.

**Dataset Details:**
- 4 sub-datasets with increasing complexity
- Multiple operational settings and fault modes
- 21 sensor measurements per time step
- Training and test sets with known and unknown failure times
